### Objective:

To develop a performance dashboard that monitors and analyzes the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns for WPP Group. The dashboard will provide real-time insights into campaign reach, engagement, and ROI, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize ongoing and future campaigns.

---

### Dataset Overview:

The dataset contains three tables:- Campaign_ID,Campaign_Name, Platform, Start_Dat, End_Date, Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Ad_Spend ($), Revenue ($), CTR (%), CPC ($), ROAS, Engagement_Score, Audience_Segment. 

---

### Key Observations:

•	Data Completeness:- There’re missing values were detected. The Summer Launch campaign on Instagram lacks conversion, click, and revenue data, which means it's either in the early stages or might not have been fully tracked. This should be addressed in reporting for a complete view of its performance.

•	Data Types:- Most fields are correctly typed (e.g. Start_Date & End_Date, Ad_Spend ($)).


---

### Initial Insights from the Data:
•	Platform Performance
•	Audience Segment Performance
•	Performance by Metrics
•	Campaign Duration

---

### Data Quality:

The data quality appears to be generally high, but there are some missing values in key metrics such as conversions, revenue, and engagement for certain campaigns (e.g., Instagram's Summer Launch), which may affect comprehensive analysis and decision-making.

---

### Dashboard Overview:

•	Campaign Overview:- Total Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Ad Spend, and Revenue for all campaigns. Overview of CTR (Click-Through Rate), CPC (Cost Per Click), and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend).

•	Platform Performance:- Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn performance metrics. Bar charts comparing Impressions, Clicks, and Conversions across platforms.

•	Audience Segment Performance:- Performance breakdown by audience segments such as Young Adults, Middle-Aged, Professionals, and All Ages. Visualization of Engagement Scores and CTR by audience type.

•	Filters & Interactivity:- Audience Segment Filters: Analyze performance by segment (Young Adults, All Ages, etc.). Platform Filters: View data for specific platforms (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook).

---

### Key Observations:
     Google Ads campaigns generally have a higher CTR and ROAS, making it a key platform for driving conversions and revenue. 
     Instagram campaigns, while generating a good number of impressions and clicks, tend to show lower conversion rates and ROAS.     
     LinkedIn campaigns target professionals and tend to have a lower CTR, but they often result in higher-quality conversions, as indicated by a higher CPC and more targeted audience segments.
